 TREES DESTROYED, OXIDATED REGES, RUINED LAPIDS. A PERSON WHO SORRYS IN SILENCE. These are the typical images that the cemeteries evoke. But not long ago, the cemeteries were happy places, with flowery gardens and a large number of people who walked among the lapids. How did the cemeteries become what they are today? Some have existed since centuries ago, like the Wadi Al-Salam, the largest in the world, where there are more than 5 million tombs. But most cemeteries are much more recent. In reality, much of human history took place without the dead receiving a burial. Our ancestors had their dead in various ways. Sometimes they were left in caves, and other times in trees or on the top of a mountain. They were even thrown into a lake, abandoned to the drift, subjected to a cannibal ritual or cremated. All these practices, strange as they seem nowadays, were ways of venerating the dead. On the other hand, the first tombs dating back to 120,000 years ago were reserved for the transgressors who were thus excluded from the usual rites to honor the dead. But the first burials had certain advantages. They protected the body from the action of animals and elements, and they also freed the deities from seeing the decomposition of the body. These benefits may have influenced the use of graves as a way to honor the dead and the dead. In some cases, these graves contained ritual or domestic objects, which suggests that they believed in the beyond, where the dead could need them. The common graves appeared for the first time in North Africa and West Asia between 10,000 and 15,000 years ago, when the first permanent settlements were produced in both areas. These sites gave rise to the graves to commemorate the dead. The nomadic Esitas erected funeral tombs or kurganes in the steppes. The Etruscans built extensive necropolis whose tombs were arranged in their streets, drawn in squares. In Rome, the underground catacombs contained crematory urns and intact remains. The word cemetery or chamber of dreams was used for the first time by the ancient Greeks, who built tombs and cemeteries at the limit of cities. In the medieval Europe, churches gave spaces to house the dead, but there were also markets, fairs and other events. They would take cattle there to graze, because they believed that the grass from the tombs would give them a sweeter milk. With the expansion of cities in the Industrial Revolution, the large suburban cemeteries replaced the smaller urban cemeteries. The 45 hectare Perla Chirs in Paris, the 29 hectare Mount Auburn in Cambridge, Massachusetts, were large parks with beautiful gardens, sculpted stones and ornamented tombs. The individual tombs, initially a luxury for the rich and powerful, began to be affordable for the middle and working classes. People went to the cemetery for funerals, but also to celebrate anniversaries or simply to spend the afternoon outdoors. At the end of the 19th century, with the appearance of new public parks and botanical gardens, the cemeteries began to lose visitors. Currently, many cemeteries are lonely places. Some attract visitors with guided tours and other events. But, even if we revive old cemeteries, the future of the burials is in consideration. London, New York and Hong Kong are running out of places for graves. Even in places where there is no space, cemeteries occupy lands that, on the contrary, could be cultivated or urbanized. Traditional cemeteries are built with materials such as metal, stone and concrete that can contaminate the soil and underground waters with toxic chemicals. Aware of the environmental impact, people look for other alternatives. Many decide to use cremation and other funerary customs. In addition to the conventional, now you can take the remains to space, use them to fertilize a tree, make jewels or make fireworks and even make ink for tattoos. In the future, these options could replace the cemeteries, definitely. Although cemeteries are our best known way to worship the dead, they are just one step further in our process of remembering and honoring them. The ancient Egyptians had a different method to honor their dead. They prepared them to go beyond, using a parchment known as the Book of the Dead. de los muertos.
